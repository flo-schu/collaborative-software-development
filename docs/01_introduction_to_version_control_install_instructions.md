## **Version control** with `git`+`ssh` and **collaborative software development** with `conda`

Florian Schunck

### Installation üõ†Ô∏è

For the workshop we need the following software

1. `git` for version control
2. `ssh` for secure (and automated) communication with remote servers
3. `conda` for reproducible environments

### Install `git`

+ Windows: https://git-scm.com/downloads (and just keep all the default settings). This will also install SSH
+ Linux (debian): `sudo apt install git`
+ Mac: Install homebrew (see https://brew.sh/) and then install git with `brew install git`.

### Become familiar with the tool

+ Open a commandline interface and type `git --help` to see if everything works. Then look at `git clone --help` to understand what happens when you clone a repository

### Install `ssh`

`git` can be used via unsecured connections, but many applications require the use of encrypted, secure connections. SSH (*s*ecure *sh*ell) operates by exchanging a public and private key between yourself and the service that you want to connect to.

### Install `ssh`

Generate an **SSH keypair** with openssh and upload to your github account (Installation guide: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-add-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)

+ ‚ö† **First**, Test if `ssh` is already available by typing `ssh --help` in your CLI 
+ Linux: ‚úÖ Usually already installed. If not: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` to update the package repositories, then `sudo apt install openssh-server openssh-client` to install ssh
+ Mac: ‚úÖ Already installed
+ Windows: ‚úÖ In modern windows versions SSH should be preinstalled. You can verify it by typing `ssh` into cmd. If not use ssh that comes with the git bash CLI.

**Generate Keys**

1. Creating a key-value pair with ssh: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`
2. Log into the https://github.com
3. Copy the public key and paste it in the respective section of your github account

### **Reproducible** software environments

Science can only be advanced if the results of previous works can be reliably reproduced. This is true for wet-lab experiments as well as for dry-lab experiments (i.e. models). **In order to make a workflow reproducible, we have to tell others what the requirements are that we run the software in.**

Conda is a package manager üì¶ that facilitates this.

First, see if conda was already installed `conda --help`, if not: Follow the instructions on: https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/#installing-miniconda
