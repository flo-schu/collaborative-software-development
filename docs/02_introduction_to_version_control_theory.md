## **Version control** with `git`+`ssh` and **collaborative software development** with `conda`

Florian Schunck

### Why do we want to do version control and collaborative software development?

* We can easily distribute code, and revise it, discuss changes, go back in time ‚è± 
* The power of many! Many people can build much better and more stable software than a single person
* **Free backups** üòé No more loss of code (and manuscripts)
* **Versioning** of software

#### Basically the moment you are writing software that you would like to use more than once, you should start thinking about version control

+ `git` (https://git-scm.com) is by far the most common tool to do version control. It is usually, but not necessarily, coupled with remote repositories that act as a remote mirror of the local repository such as https://gitlab.uni-onsabrueck.de
+ `git` is a command line tool, this means it is used with the terminal (linux, mac), cmd or powershell (Windows). Whenever you need to understand how git works, it is **help**ful to consult `git --help`
